This split plot data is from Chambers and Hastie (1993, p. 158). There are 8 varieties of guayule (rubber plant) and 4 treatments were applied to seeds. The response was the rate of germination. The whole plots were greenhouse flats and the subplots were subplots of the flats. Each flat received seeds of one variety (A). Each subplot contained 100 seeds and was treated with one of the treatments (B). There were m = 3 replications so each variety was planted in 3 flats for a total of 24 flats and 4(24) = 96 observations.

In Problem 13.11, you showed that this was a good full model.a) Using what you have learned in class find a good submodel and include
the relevant output in Word.
(Hints: Use forward selection and backward elimination and find the model Imin with the smallest AIC. Let Δ(I) = AIC(I)−AIC(Imin). Then find the model II with the fewest number of predictors such that Δ(II) ≤ 2. Then submodel II is the initial submodel to examine. Fit model II and look at the Wald test p–values. Try to eliminate predictors with large p–values but make sure that the deviance does not increase too much. Also examine submodels I with fewer predictors than II with Δ(I) ≤ 7. You may have several models, say P2, P3, P4, and P5 to look at. Make a scatterplot matrix of the Pi:ETA’U from these models and from the full model P1. Make the EE and response plots for each model. The correlation in the EE plot should be at least 0.9 and preferably greater than 0.95. As a very rough guide for Poisson regression, the number of predictors in the full model should be less than n/5 and the number of predictors in the final submodel should be less than n/10.)
b) Make a response plot for your final submodel, say P2. From Graph&Fit select Plot of. Select P2:Eta’U for the H box and y for the V box. From the OLS popup menu select Poisson and move the slider bar to 1. Move the lowess slider bar until the lowess curve tracks the exponential curve well. Include the response plot in Word.

Try to eliminate predictors with large p–values but make sure that the deviance does not increase too much. Also examine submodels I with fewer predictors than II with Δ(I) ≤ 7. WARNING: do not delete part of a factor. Either keep all 2 factor dummy variables or delete all I-1=2 factor dummy variables. You may have several models, say B2, B3, B4, and B5 to look at. Make the EE and response plots for each model. WARNING: if a useful factor is in the full model but not the reduced model, then the EE plot may have I = 3 lines if the factor should be in the model. See part h) below.]

This action adds the identity line to the plot. Include the plot in Word.
If the EE plot is good, then the plotted points will cluster about the identity line. For model II, some points are far away from the identity line. At least one variable needs to be added to model II to get a good submodel and EE plot, violating the rule of thumb that submodels with more predictors than II should not be examined. Variable selection may be suggesting poor submodels because of clusters of cases that are given exact probabilities of 0 or 1. Try adding {F}RACE to the predictors in II .
